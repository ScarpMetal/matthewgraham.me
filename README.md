This is the public repository for Matthew Graham's personal portfolio website. You can visit the finished website [here](https://matthewgraham.me/). If the link does not work, then I am still working on the site!

## Why all this code for a simple portfolio site?
I wanted to create a content delivery platform for myself as a challenge and also for easily updating my projects.
